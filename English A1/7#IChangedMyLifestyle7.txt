			Story about my Father) #IChangedMyLifestyle


Denis Suvorov lives in Penza, in Russia. He's 42, and he's business man. My father working every day and after work he's like listening to music. He's likes listening to rap. His favorite musical artists - it's ICEGERGERT, BabyCute, OG Buda, Kai angel, 9mice, Obladaet.
My father every weekend likes waking up at 9-10 am, and chilling just with family. For Example every weekend we just played poker in the evening. And every wednesday after work he goes for a massage. Recently my father bought new car and when i'm learnt about this - he's say me: "Son i'm bought new charger my iPhone" - I'm laughing very loudly. My father very smart and humoristical men, because with him you can talking about everything. I love my father. My father - THE BEST.
